My research focuses on the intersection between AI/ML and networked systems, especially for 5G/6G, network securities, and energy trading. I am dedicated to developing novel AI/ML techniques for network problems, including resource allocation, computational task offloading, energy efficiency, and network security with intelligent attacks and defence. I am also interested in large language model (LLM)-enabled communication networks, i.e., retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for network-LLM, using LLMs for explainable network decision-making, and deploying LLMs at the network edge and cloud.
