I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Computer Science, McGill University, Canada, supervised by [Dr. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html). I completed my PhD degree at University of Ottawa, Canada, from 2019 to 2023, and my supervisor is [Dr. Melike Erol-Kantarci](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~merolka2/). Before that, I completed my B.Eng. in Huazhong University of Sci. and Tech. in 2016, and M.Eng. in Tianjin University in 2019, China. 

About my Research 
======
My research focuses on the intersection between AI/ML and networked systems, especially for 5G/6G, network securities, and energy trading. 
I am dedicated to developing novel AI/ML techniques for network problems, including resource allocation, computational task offloading, energy efficiency, and network security with intelligent attacks and defence. 
I am also interested in large language model (LLM)-enabled communication networks, i.e., retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for network-LLM, using LLMs for explainable network decision-making, and deploying LLMs at the network edge and cloud.

I have published more than 40 peer-reviewed papers, e.g., IEEE Wireless Communications, IEEE Trans. Smart Grid, and IEEE Communications Survey & Tutorials. One of my papers received the Best Paper Award at the 2023 IEEE ICC conference (one of 16 papers from 2778 submissions), which is one of the flagship conferences in communication society. 
I also received the 2023 IEEE ComSoc CSIM TC Best Journal Paper Award for my contributions to transfer learning-enabled network slicing. My PhD Thesis entitled “ML-Based Optimization of Large-Scale Systems: Case Study in Smart Microgrids and 5G RAN” won the 2023 Faculty of Engineering’s Best Doctoral Thesis Award at University of Ottawa (1st position among all PhD graduates of the engineering faculty in 2023).
