I am a team leader for this project and supervise 3 PhD students. It aims to investigate how stateof-the-art large language model (LLM) techniques can be used for efficient and flexible nextG wireless networks. As the main proposal writer, this collaboration has been granted the Samsung Global Research Outreach (GRO)
program (150,000 USD for 1 year, and only 11 projects are selected worldwide).
